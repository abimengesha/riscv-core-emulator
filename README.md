# riscv-core-emulator

## 🖥️ Overview
This project implements a **RISC-V Core Emulator and Cache Simulator** with a **five-stage pipeline**, instruction decoding, branch prediction, and hazard detection.


## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ **Five-stage pipeline:** 
- ✅ **Branch Prediction & Hazard Handling**
- ✅ **Instruction Decoding & Register File**
- ✅ **Memory Management & Cache Simulation**
- ✅ **Written in Digital Logic (.dig) & Python**

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for instruction decoding and memory handling
- Cycle-by-cycle inspection for verifying pipeline stalls and hazards
- Benchmarked using test programs with various instruction patterns

### 🛠 Tools & Languages
- Assembly & C
- Digital Logic Design (.dig)

### 💡 What I Learned
- The fundamentals of CPU pipeline architecture and instruction flow
- How to simulate data hazards and branch prediction in a five-stage pipeline
- Low-level debugging using memory inspection and test cycles
- The structure and behavior of a RISC-V emulator at the hardware/software interface
- How cache memory and memory-mapped I/O affect processor performance
